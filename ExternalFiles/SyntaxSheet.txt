start     :: Must be placed at the beginning of each program.
show      :: Used to print to the console. Takes strings with ("Hello, world!"), and variables (x).
as        :: Decleration for variables, placed after the variable name. E.g. x as Int, y as Bool.
end       :: Must be placed at the end of each program.
if        :: Example below. Use to assess a boolean and execute a result.
fi        :: End an if.
otherwise :: Used as a default if statement decider.
|         :: Used as an else.
do        :: To form loops (example below).
od        :: End a do.
fun       :: Declare a function.
none      :: Used is a function has no return value.
result    :: Equal to return in other languages.

Example program:

~Semi colons are optional!
start;

a as Int = 5;
b as Int = 10;

answer as Int = 0

if a<b -> answer := b
| b<a -> answer := a
| otherwise -> answer := 0
fi

i as Int = 1

show("Counting to your number...")

do i<=answer
  count(i)
  i++
od

fun count(i as Int: none)
  show(i)
nuf

end;

Will produce:

Counting to your number...
