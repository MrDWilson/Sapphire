Hello, and welcome to Sapphire.

Writing programs in Sapphire is simple and quick, converting to Scala code
rather than using it's own compiler.

Please refer to the External Files folder, the Syntax Sheet in particular
so you understand the Syntax.

Then, using Atom to write your files (Atom package for Sapphire can be found
here... https://atom.io/packages/language-sapphire, or by searching for
language-sapphire within Atom).

After you have wrote your Sapphire program, make sure to save it in the
SapphireExecutables folder! Then run the Sapphire.sh script (with ./sapphire.sh), enter your file
name and let it parse. Sapphire will convert the code into Scala, and then
execute the code for you. To look at the Scala source file, simply enter the
ScalaExecutables folder and open it.
